# D3C_Human_Rights_Research

For our project, I reccomend using 2 main tools, [GitHub](https://github.com/) (which you are already on!) and [JupyterNotebook](https://jupyter.org/).
Github is super useful if we want to collaborate on code, check our work, and eventually create a website for our visualizations! 
Separately, we should use Jupyter Notebook because it makes sure that the code we write all shares the same dependencies. 
This reduces errors when we are collaborating on our code, as we are all going to be running the same version of Python.

### Datasets

For the time being, I believe these will be the most useful for our analysis. 

### UNHCR
[Refugee Statistics](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics)
### Global Human Settlement 
[1975 - 2030](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/ghs_pop2023.php)
### Global History Climatology Network daily
[Daily Climate Surveys](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily)
### 2024 Energy Usage Report
Study on 2024 Data Center usage from [Berkley Lab](https://eta.lbl.gov/publications/2024-lbnl-data-center-energy-usage-report)
### US Data Center Locator 
[Geolocation of Data Centers](https://www.datacentermap.com/usa/)


With these, we can query data regarding our questions of interest.
After we obtain and clean the data, we should be free to work in any software that works best for our team!
